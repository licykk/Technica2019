<h1>Mexican Society & Culture</h1>
 
<h2>Mexican Family Values</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The family is at the centre of the social structure.</li>
  <li>Outside of the major cosmopolitan cities, families are still generally large.</li>
  <li>The extended family is as important as the nuclear family since it provides a sense of stability.</li>
  <li>Mexicans consider it their duty and responsibility to help family members. For example, the will help find employment or finance a house or other large purchase.</li>
  <li>Most Mexican families are extremely traditional, with the father as the head, the authority figure and the decision-maker.</li>
  <li>Mothers are greatly revered, but their role may be seen as secondary to that of their husband.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hierarchical Society</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mexican society and business are highly stratified and vertically structured.</li>
  <li>Mexicans emphasize hierarchical relationships.</li>
  <li>People respect authority and look to those above them for guidance and decision-making.</li>
  <li>Rank is important, and those above you in rank must always be treated with respect.</li>
  <li>This makes it important to know which person is in charge, and leads to an authoritarian approach to decision-making and problem- solving.</li>
  <li>It would be disrespectful to break the chain of hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
